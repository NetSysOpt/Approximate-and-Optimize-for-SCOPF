# Approximate-and-Optimize for SCOPF
Repository for `An Approximate-and-Optimize Method for
Security-Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow`

There are two parts in this repository:
- `approx-optimize-scopf`: collecting base case solutions, building and solving the surrogate scopf problem, implemented using Julia
- `scopf-approx`: generating scenario datasets and training the neural network, implemented using Python.

For more detail, please refer to the README.md for each repository respectively.
